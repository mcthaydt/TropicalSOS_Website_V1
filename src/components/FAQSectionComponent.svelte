		<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>
				A micro-incubator is a specialized type of startup incubator, but on a smaller scale. While
				traditional incubators provide a comprehensive range of resources and support services to
				nurture multiple startups simultaneously, a micro-incubator focuses on a more intimate and
				hands-on approach with a limited number of companies at a time.
